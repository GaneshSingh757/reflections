How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

diff at the least finds the lines where there are differences between files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

We can access any version of the file at any time if needed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

While manually commiting one might forget to commit important changes or make some useless commits with improper descriptions.
Manual commiting if done properly is the best because an invidual knows what is important and what is not in his project.
Automatic commit might save useless versions.
Automatic commit is best for guys who forget.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is meant for big projects which involve number of files related to each other while others don't serve the exact purpose.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows for what purposes changes were made while git diff shows the exact changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

No matter what we can restore previous versions hence greater flexibility for changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
