When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a project involving multiple people. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

We may not want to update our local repo if someone make changes on remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork is copying one github repo from another account to own github account for usage while cloning is copying github repo as a local repo. Branches are
 for adding or experimenting features away from master branch either locally or on github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

We can locally see what changes were made by other collaborators on github.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without github I used google drive to save all files and then collaborated with other people by doing conversations which was really not practical.
